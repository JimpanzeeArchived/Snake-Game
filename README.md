# Snake-Game
###DESCRIPTION: 
Just a regular snake game. The users can use buttons to move the snake and monitor the game using the MAX7219 8x8 LED display. If the snake’s head touches any of the snake’s body, the game restarts. The food is repopulated at random locations. The body of the snake increases by one node if the snake’s head touches the food piece. The complete version of the snake game would have incorporated four MAX7219 displays and soldered onto a customized PCB. Below is how the project works on a single LED display hardware prototype.
